A person must be assigned to an app before it can access it.

Lets assign the [person](add-person) we previously created to our app.

1. From the admin console, navigate to **Applications** -> **Applications**.
1. Select your app.
1. Click on the **Users** tab.
1. Click the **Add User Assignment** button.
1. Choose the created identity (e.g., _Jared Dunn_).
1. Click **Save**.

{% img alt="App User Assignment" name="app_user_assignment.gif" width=800 height=800 /%}

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

The person is now assigned to the app, lets [try to login](try-to-login).
